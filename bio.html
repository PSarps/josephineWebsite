      <div class="section-title">Meet Josephine Ampomah Boateng</div>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Josephine Ampomah Boateng, an Optometrist with a Master’s degree in Health Systems Research. I'm passionate about providing accessible and quality eye care, particularly for underserved communities. Over the years, I've gained expertise in low vision care, pediatric eye health, and community-based rehabilitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          My mission is to bridge the gap between clinical research and real-world applications for effective patient care. I’m constantly striving to make healthcare more accessible and impactful for all, especially in underserved areas.

      <!-- Professional Background Section -->
      <div class="section-title">Professional Background</div>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>
          I graduated from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) with a Bachelor's degree in Optometry. Building on this foundation, I went on to complete my Master’s degree in Health Systems Research, with a focus on healthcare accessibility and the management of vision impairments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I have worked extensively on low vision care, particularly in areas where healthcare services are limited. My experience spans clinical assessments, research, training healthcare professionals, and advocating for the implementation of effective, accessible healthcare solutions.

        <p>
          As part of my commitment to improving healthcare, I have co-authored 2 research papers published in scientific journals, focusing on the gap in low vision care in Ghana. I've also been a part of the HM-KNUST Low Vision Project, where I had the opportunity to train healthcare professionals and raise awareness on the impact of low vision care interventions.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my primary goals is to enhance the quality of eye care through advocacy and continuous research. I’m currently involved in several projects focused on creating more sustainable and accessible models of vision rehabilitation.
