      <div class="section-title">Elevator Pitch</div>
      <p class="elevator-pitch">
        My name is Josephine Boateng. I am an optometrist with a Master's in Health Systems Research, and over the past years, I have gained invaluable experience in low vision care, pediatric eye health, and community-based rehabilitation. I excel in three critical areas: conducting precise clinical assessments in low vision, developing outreach and training programs for underserved communities, and conducting scientific research of community importance.
        <br><br>
        What sets me apart is my proven track record in organising training programs for professionals to equip themselves with the skills required to provide quality health care. I also have a passion for driving innovation and practical solutions to enhance healthcare in my country through advocacy. Through my research work, I have drawn attention and consequent interventions towards low vision in my country.
        <br><br>
        I can help employers and partners bridge the gap between clinical research and real-world application, ultimately making patient care more effective, accessible, and life-changing. 
        <br><br>
        I’m looking to connect with organisations or academic programs ready to invest in innovative approaches to vision rehabilitation. If you're seeking someone who can transform vision care into tangible improvements in patients' lives, let’s talk about how I can contribute to your team.
        <br><br>
        Thank you for your time, and I look forward to exploring potential opportunities together.
